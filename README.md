# üöó Transportation Technology Insights

This repository showcases the technical expertise and innovations my team and I have driven in advancing large-scale transportation solutions. Our nationwide connected vehicle data platform processes 700 million transactions per day, ingests 300GB of data daily across 200+ datasets, and integrates thousands of IoT devices. Built in under two quarters, this platform has already scaled to over 11,000 transactions per second, delivering real-time insights that power next-generation mobility and safety applications. With two patents pending and multiple industry-recognized publications, our work pushes the boundaries of data processing, connected vehicle intelligence, and transportation technology.
